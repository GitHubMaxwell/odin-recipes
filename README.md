# Odin Recipes

Pratice HTML by building a basic recipe website.

## Idea

Turn the list of recipes on the homepage into a slider of cards (like one of the sliders from apple product pages - see iphone 16 e for reference)
Store recipe data in a folder. Have a recipe template that defines the expected structure of a recipe
load in data for each recipe from these files
